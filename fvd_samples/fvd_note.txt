# FVD file format
#

FVD is a malware signature database file that is assembled from five type of part files: .hdb, .cdb, .xdb, .sdb, .wdb.

All part files are optional except file .hdb.

=================
1. File .hdb
=================

Contains file header information.

Content Format:
    DbMajorVersion:DbMinorVersion:MinimalAvMajorVersion:MinimalAvMinorVersion

Field Description:
    DbMajorVersion: dword           # Major version of database
	
    DbMinorVersion: byte            # Minor version of database
	
    MinimalAvMajorVersion: word     # Minimum major version of AV for using database
	
    MinimalAvMinorVersion: byte     # Minimum minor version of AV for using database
